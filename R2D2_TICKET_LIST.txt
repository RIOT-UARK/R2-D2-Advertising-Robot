R2D2 SOFTWARE TICKET LIST:

[HeadAudioBoard]/[BodyESP32_Receiver] Write and tune emote functions for emotes 1, 3, and 4

[All] Perhaps make configurable gain values in R2D2_LIB. E.g: stick dead zone, motor drive speed, etc.
[All] Investigate and confirm behavior if Controller dies.
[All] More thoroughly verify Emergency Disconnect Mode

[HeadFacialDetection] Cut out all of the OSD drawing fat.

[BodyESP32_Receiver] Occasional random audio (or subset of audio) while in AI Cam mode.
[BodyESP32_Receiver] HIGH PRIORITY: ESP32 spews garbage over serial on startup. You can connect Pin 15 to ground to prevent this, or we can investigate a better/safer way to communicate with secondary motor driver
[3-Byte Serial Transmission]: Arduino Uno can handle ~500Hz update rate while unburdened. Targeting 100Hz.
[BodyESP32_Receiver] Ensure that channel2 value of ~255 is achievable

[HeadLEDController] LOW PRIORITY Implement periscope
[HeadLEDController] LOW PRIORITY: Reimplement  back psi fading w/ improvements
[HeadLEDController] Enumerate Color selections6

[Secondary_Motor_Driver] Tune PD Servo values.
[Secondary_Motor_Driver] Emergency Disconnect if receiving a lot of garbage.
[Secondary_Motor_Driver] Consider decreasing dead zone size

[TEST] Test Emergency Disconnect
[TEST] Test Emotes

[Code Review] HeadLEDController. Was previously having issues where front Psi light would flash incredibly quickly.
